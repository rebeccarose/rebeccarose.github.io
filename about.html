		<h2>Why I love what I do</h2>
		<h3>Simplifying complex problems with elegant solutions</h3>
		<p>Few things are more satisfying to me than transforming something that was previously confusing or difficult into something that's intuitive and delightful.</p>
		
		<h3>Learning basic truths about human behavior and design principles</h3>
		<p>Understanding the science behind why we like or don't like things helps me be not only a better designer, but a better communicator, spouse and friend.</p>

		<h3>Gathering inspiration</h3>
		<p>I renew my creativity by reading, visiting physical and digital galleries, and playing with new apps and devices. Learning how others are solving challenges energizes me and I synthesize and apply their insights to my own work.</p>
		
		<h3>Collaborating with awesome people</h3>
		<p>Working with some of the best minds in business, engineering, and content strategy continually teaches me about other disciplines and instills in me a deep appreciation for their talents and craft. Together we develop better solutions than we would have each done separately.</p>
